# assumptions

We have a heightmap or something similar for the land we are working on.

# Results

We categorise the areas of the land in some way. 

We need to at least have water and land identified, but the land could then be further subdivides into something like the catan tile categories (lumber(probably hills? need water), wheat(large flat areas, good for plowing. often floodplains), wool(graze-able area. societies generally make these from woodlands.), brick(I dunno, hills at the edges of floodplains?) and rock (mountains)).

What categories we divide them it into needs to be defined, along with rules to identify them correctly.
