The settlements will be made by people. Or ants. You decide.
	
	An idea for how they behave: neural networks that are trained by the cruelties of the world. 
	
	Pro: we won't have to program them to find the ideal places to build houses, they will learn that themselves.
	
	Con: The neural nets will need to be implemented. Also, it might be overkill. (what will they be trained on?)

We probably don't want to simulate each individual person individually, but that might actually be easier.

## What the people might do:

 * Collect and/or eat food and water
 * build [structures](settlements.md)
	 - houses
	 - roads
	 - possibly boats?
	 - dams??
 * entertain an audience?
 * pass on information?
 * explore?
	 - look at
