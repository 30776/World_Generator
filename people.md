The settlements will be made by people. Or ants. You decide.
	
	An idea for how they behave: neural networks that are trained by the cruelties of the world. 
	
	Pro: we won't have to program them to find the ideal places to build houses, they will learn that themselves.
	
	Con: The neural nets will need to be implemented. Also, it might be overkill.

We probably don't want to simulate each individual person individually, but that might actually be easier.
