# Assumptions:

The actual landscape is there. And not only do we have the height of the various places, we also have the areas categorised in some [manner](categories.md).

# Results

The people will need resources. Water is the most important, but food is quite high on the list, as well as shelter (note: caves? probably makes the inputs too complicated). 

Now, we could allow the construction of shelter for free, or we could not.

A thing we will want is for them to have a reason to stick together. I would recommend something like making the food produced in an area to go up with the square of the number of people working on it. This would then free up people to build houses, raise the young or whatever other tasks we add for them to do.
